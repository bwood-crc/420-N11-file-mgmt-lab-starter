              The Life and Times of Dante

                      by Dante Pocai


Mention "Aligheri" and few may know about whom you are talking. Say 
"Dante" instead, and the whole world knows whom you mean. For
Dante Alighieri, like Raphael, Michelangelo, Galileo, etc. is usually
referred to by his first name
